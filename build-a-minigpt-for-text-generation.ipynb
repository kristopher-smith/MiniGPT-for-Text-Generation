There are currently several ways to mitigate these comments(for those organizations who wish to do so). Some of these ways include human moderators, and training machine learning models to detect toxicity in online comments.\n\nThe issue with human moderators is that some of these platforms have grown so large so quickly that there are not nearly enough moderators to achieve any sense of control for most of these comments. The shear volume of toxicity and bots online makes it unrealistic to think we could do this job with humans at this point.\n\nMany companies are employing machine learning to assist with identifying toxic comments online automatically. The problem with this approach is the lack of labeled training data to train the models on.\n\nThis is the problem I am going to solve using generative deep learning techniques.

can see that these comments on average are quite short in length and contain more nouns than verbs on average.\n\nSince we have not done any cleaning of the data yet these distributions are not exact as the nltk package is not currently looking for misspelled words or different versions of word spellings which are used online sometimes.\n\nFor example if a user knows that the platform they are on has limitations on language than they may spell a profane word to try to fool any auto detecting systems such as `Fuck==>Fxck, F*ck, Fukk, Fuuu*uukk`, etc.\n\nTherefore these counts will not detect all nouns and verbs but should give a decent sample.\n\nKnowing the underlying distributions of some of these features is important because after the synthetic data is generated we would most likely

initial 10 or so most common bi-grams and tri-grams are repetitive punctuation marks.\n\nTraditionally these would be cleaned and removed when training models for NLP tasks, however due to the nature of this work many of these traditional techniques will limit the models ability to predict toxicity as well as with clean text.\n\nI happened to have competed in this competition and one thing all of us learned was that leaving capital letters and punctuation improved the models ability to infer toxicity and especially levels of toxicity. \n\nFor example a phrase such as:\n\n`Are you kidding?`\n\nConveys a much different meaning than the same words but put this way:\n\n`ARE YOU KIDDING!!!??`\n\nTraditional NLP techniques would have us convert all characters to lower case and remove punctuation so the model will interpret both of those texts the exact same way.\n\nWhen training sentiment based models or models where feeling and emotion is being conveyed in some way such as toxicity of comments, it is more than just the raw content of the words alone which gives the meaning.

It is interesting to me that with all of the data in the world there is still a shortage of industrial sized, cleaned, organized, and labeled training data. \n\n* It would seem that allthough in academia the glory goes to the next new model or algorithm when really the training data is probably more important at this point. It does not matter how fancy an algorithm is(some of them are pretty fancy) or a model is, without good training data we are limited in the problems we can tackle effectively.\n\n* During this project I researched training data sets and where they come from. Most of the open source ones come from a handful of instituions namely universities with a few corporations willing to share the training datasets or models which would not effect their market share significantly releasing them.\n\n* Even the sensitive subjetcs such as the language used in this projects training data is very important to solve very prominent problems we have.\n\n## Decisions made along the way\n* I started off this project trying to adapt a GAN to acheive this tast but there is little work done in this area and I had a lot of trouble trying to implement one of the papers where they achieve this task.\n\n* I chose this method as this model is lightweight and quick to train and tune for any specific style of language. As I mentioned at the beginning I originally tested this capabillity on the movie lines IMDB dataset and had great results. \n\n* The dataset I used turned out to be admittedly smaller than probably needed to get better results but I am confident that once I wrange up more nasty online comments the model will do much better after retraining.\n\n* The feature dimensions in the attention head made a huge difference on training time and performance. I had better results at 512 than it is currently at (256) but the time to train 25 epochs grew exponentially. If I had more Kaggle GPU hours I would have done my final training round with 512 in the attention head.\n\n* I originally tried a custom learning rate optimizing function but because of the large differences in epochs I was trying for different experiments I switched over to just using ADAM for this task.\n\n* The starting prompt matters. I found out that after looking at the popular bigrams and trigrams if I chose those sequences the model would generate sensible text more easily. \n\n* The length of the starting prompt also effects how different each output is dramatically.\n\n## Whats Next\n\n* I am going to run this model and compile a set of generated texts which are known to be toxic and add them to the training set and retrain the BERT based model I used when competing in this competition to see what results I get with the added training data.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Save and load model for future use","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# model_path = '../working/Toxic_MiniGPT.h5'\n\n# # Save the model\n# model.save(model_path)\n\n# ## Load the model\n# from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model\n\n# # Register the custom layer\n# tf.keras.utils.get_custom_objects()['TransformerBlock'] = TransformerBlock\n\n# # Load the model\n# model = load_model(model_path)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-26T01:52:37.638937Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-26T01:52:37.639346Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-26T01:52:37.644745Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-26T01:52:37.639314Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-26T01:52:37.643497Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":37,"outputs":[]}]}
