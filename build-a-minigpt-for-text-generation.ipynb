There are currently several ways to mitigate these comments(for those organizations who wish to do so). Some of these ways include human moderators, and training machine learning models to detect toxicity in online comments.\n\nThe issue with human moderators is that some of these platforms have grown so large so quickly that there are not nearly enough moderators to achieve any sense of control for most of these comments. The shear volume of toxicity and bots online makes it unrealistic to think we could do this job with humans at this point.\n\nMany companies are employing machine learning to assist with identifying toxic comments online automatically. The problem with this approach is the lack of labeled training data to train the models on.\n\nThis is the problem I am going to solve using generative deep learning techniques.

There are versions of these comments labeled by human annotators wherein they label each comment as toxic or not, or other sets where they were labeled as different categories of toxic such as hatespeech, racist/sexist, obscene, etc. Although these are the labeled datasets we would be adding the synthetic data to in order to create more training data, for this task of simply generating similar text data we will only focus on the comments themselves.\n\nThe data provided by this competition includes a total of `14,251` unique toxic comments.

One column labeled less toxic was a comment which human annotators labeled as less toxic than its more toxic counterpart in the other column. There was no actual training data where a comment was paired with its severity rating. The models were trained using creative techniques with the validation data and other classification data sets to train a model which predicted severity of comments.\n\nSince for our purposes we are only interested in the actual text comments themselves, I will only be using those columns from these datasources.\n\nI start by reading them all into pandas dataframes, isolating the text columns from each one, and stacking them all together so we have a single column of text when it is all said and done.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data1 = pd.read_csv('../input/jigsaw-toxic-severity-rating/comments_to_score.csv')\ndata1.info()\n\n## Isolate only text column\ndata1 = data1['text']\n\ndata1.sample(6)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-25T19:26:40.824515Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-25T19:26:40.826957Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-25T19:26:40.888692Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-25T19:26:40.826930Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-25T19:26:40.887650Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":26,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\nRangeIndex: 7537 entries, 0 to 7536\nData columns (total 2 columns):\n #   Column      Non-Null Count  Dtype \n---  ------      --------------  ----- \n 0   comment_id  7537 non-null   int64 \n 1   text        7537 non-null   object\ndtypes: int64(1), object(1)\nmemory usage: 117.9+ KB\n","output_type":"stream"},{"execution_count":26,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"3265    \"HEY VACUOS, EMPTY- MINDED COLA!

can see that these comments on average are quite short in length and contain more nouns than verbs on average.\n\nSince we have not done any cleaning of the data yet these distributions are not exact as the nltk package is not currently looking for misspelled words or different versions of word spellings which are used online sometimes.\n\nFor example if a user knows that the platform they are on has limitations on language than they may spell a profane word to try to fool any auto detecting systems such as `Fuck==>Fxck, F*ck, Fukk, Fuuu*uukk`, etc.\n\nTherefore these counts will not detect all nouns and verbs but should give a decent sample.\n\nKnowing the underlying distributions of some of these features is important because after the synthetic data is generated we would most likely

marks.\n\nTraditionally these would be cleaned and removed when training models for NLP tasks, however due to the nature of this work many of these traditional techniques will limit the models ability to predict toxicity as well as with clean text.\n\nI happened to have competed in this competition and one thing all of us learned was that leaving capital letters and punctuation improved the models ability to infer toxicity and especially levels of toxicity. \n\nFor example a phrase such as:\n\n`Are you kidding?`\n\nConveys a much different meaning than the same words but put this way:\n\n`ARE YOU KIDDING!!!??`\n\nTraditional NLP techniques would have us convert all characters to lower case and remove punctuation so the model will interpret both of those texts the exact same way.\n\nWhen training sentiment based models or models where feeling and emotion is being conveyed in some way such as toxicity of comments, it is more than just the raw content of the words alone which gives the meaning. The puncuation and capitalizations are very expressive forms of language and as such for these problems do better left in the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Pre-Processing\n\n* First we need load in our text column as tensorflow formatted dataset\n\n* Next we shuffle the data to avoid any patterns which may have been present\n\n* We then slice the data into batches for processing\n\n* Vectorize the text which will be used to create a corpus of vocabulary used when training and act as vector representations of our text\n\n* Create the corpus of vocabulary which is used to train and evaluate throughout","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"vocab_size = 20000  ## Only consider the top 20k words\nmaxlen = 80  ## Max sequence length\nbatch_size = 32  ## Data loading batch sizes\n\n# Create a dataset from the pandas column\ntext_ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(text_column)\n\n# Shuffle and batch the dataset\ntext_ds = text_ds.shuffle(buffer_size=256)\ntext_ds = text_ds.batch(batch_size)\n\n# def custom_standardization(input_string):\n#     \"\"\" Remove html line-break tags and handle punctuation \"\"\"\n#     lowercased = tf.strings.lower(input_string)\n#     stripped_html = tf.strings.regex_replace(lowercased, \"<br />\", \" \")\n#     return tf.strings.regex_replace(stripped_html, f\"([{string.punctuation}])\", r\" \\1\")\n\n\n## Create a vectorization layer and adapt it to the text\nvectorize_layer = TextVectorization(\n    standardize=None,\n    max_tokens=vocab_size - 1,\n    output_mode=\"int\",\n    output_sequence_length=maxlen + 1,\n)\nvectorize_layer.adapt(text_ds)\nvocab = vectorize_layer.get_vocabulary()  ## To get words back from token indices","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-25T19:26:44.099249Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-25T19:26:44.099875Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-25T19:26:45.496472Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-25T19:26:44.099839Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-25T19:26:45.495338Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":34,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Generate Labels\n\nSince we are building a generative auto-regressive model, we must train it to predict the next word by looking backwards and using the previous tokens to predict the highest probability for the next token.\n\nThis is fairly easy to create labels for because we simply shuffle the `TRUE` data be one token and then when training the model compares the predicted text with the next indexed word.\n\nWe can inspect what these samples and labels look like below:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Function to create target column\ndef prepare_lm_inputs_labels(text):\n    \"\"\"\n    Shift word sequences by 1 position so that the target for position (i) is\n    word at position (i+1).
